    Creative Inspiration: Discover unique and harmonious color combinations that elevate your designs.

    Effortless Selection: Easily browse generated palettes and copy HEX codes with a single click.

‚úÖ Real-time Accessibility Checker

Ensure your designs are legible and compliant with global standards.

    WCAG Compliance: Check the contrast ratio between foreground and background colors against WCAG AA and AAA guidelines.

    Live Feedback: Get instant visual and textual feedback on your color choices, helping you make on-the-fly adjustments.

    Example Preview: See your text on a chosen background color to visualize the accessibility impact directly.

üëÅÔ∏è Comprehensive Color Blindness Simulation

Design for inclusivity from the start.

    Multiple Simulations: View your designs through the lens of various color blindness types, including Protanopia, Deuteranopia, Tritanopia, and Monochromacy.

    Upload & Analyze: Upload any design image and instantly apply simulations to understand how different users perceive your work.

    Ensure Clarity: Identify potential legibility issues and adjust your palettes to ensure your message reaches every audience.

üöÄ How to Use

While Palette Perfect is built as an Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator plugin, this demonstration showcases its core functionalities through a web interface.

    Image/Design Upload or Pick:

        Click "Upload Image" to bring your own design into the tool.

        Alternatively, use "Pick from Gallery" to load a sample image and instantly see the tool in action. The uploaded/selected image will appear in the "Image Preview" section.

    Color Palette Generation:

        Choose a Base Color using the color picker.

        Click "Generate Palette" to see a variety of harmonious color suggestions based on your selected base color.

        Click on any color swatch to instantly copy its HEX code to your clipboard.

    Accessibility Checker:

        Select a Foreground Color (e.g., text color) and a Background Color using the respective color pickers.

        Click "Check Contrast".

        The tool will display the WCAG contrast ratio and indicate whether it meets AA or AAA standards for accessibility. A live preview will show your chosen colors.

    Color Blindness Simulation:

        Ensure you have an image loaded in the "Image/Design Upload" section (either uploaded or from the gallery).

        Select the desired simulation type (Normal, Protanopia, Deuteranopia, Tritanopia, Monochromacy) using the radio buttons.

        Click "Apply Simulation" to see how your loaded image appears under that specific color vision deficiency. Compare it with the "Original" view.

üõ†Ô∏è Installation (Placeholder for Plugin)

(Note: As this is a conceptual project demo, specific installation steps for an actual Adobe plugin are not yet fully implemented. This section would typically describe how to install the .zxp or .ccx file via Adobe Creative Cloud or a third-party extension manager.)

‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

    HTML5: Structure of the web interface.

    Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling.

    JavaScript: Core logic for color calculations, image processing, accessibility checks, and color blindness simulations.

    AI/Machine Learning Concepts: Applied for generating harmonious color palettes.
